    <p>On China’s most influential microblogging platform, a wristwatch aficionado named Boss Hua accuses a government official of corruption. But, his posts aren’t censored. So what disappears into the black box of Chinese censorship...and what stays online? A team of social scientists cracked this question—by mistake—with big data.</p>

      <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: I'm Elah.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: And I'm Annie. And you're listening to Undiscovered, a podcast about the backstories of science. This story starts with a crash.</p>

      <p>JOSH CHIN: This really horrific traffic collision on a highway in Shaanxi province, which is in northwestern China.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: That’s Josh Chin—reporter for the Wall Street Journal in Beijing. And the crash he’s talking about happened in August of 2012.</p>

      <p>JOSH CHIN: A double decker sleeper bus slammed into a tanker carrying a flammable material. I think it was methane.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: 36 people died. In a state news photo, you can see the blackened husk of the bus sitting on the side of the road. There are some cops in reflective vests. And then, at very back of the picture...you notice this <em>guy</em>.</p>

      <p>JOSH CHIN: This sort of portly, official-looking guy sort of standing next to the charred wreckage, sort of smiling…very unperturbed by the scene.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: Users on Sina Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, they noticed the smiling man in the picture. And they were livid.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: So here are some sample posts from social media, courtesy of our translator, Isabelle. And you can hear it—people are just venting their frustration at this man.</p>

      <p>ISABELLE: This one says, “With a massive belly from over-eating, smiling and laughing at the scene of death. Simply inhuman.” And, “Since he loves smiling so much, I hope these unfortunate dead souls can just take him away with them. Let him smile to his content down there in hell.” </p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: So, Weibo users, they try to figure out who this guy was. And they went on the internet, did a bunch of image searches basically trying to turn up more pictures of him. And they hit pay dirt. The smiler was Yang Dacai. Communist party official...and head of the Shanxi province work safety administration.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: Pretty much the last guy you want smiling at the site of a fatal accident.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: Right. And these Weibo users turned up something else too: picture after picture of Yang Dacai out on site visits, or giving interviews, in the office—wearing different luxury wristwatches.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: Yeah, that's not good.</p>

      <p>JOSH CHIN: Watches on the order of thousands of dollars and probably much more than your average provincial official can afford.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: Or...afford without taking bribes.</p>

      <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: Today on the show, we are going to bring you the story of that smiling official—Yang Dacai—and the Weibo user who took him down. And we’re going to try to explain how this even happens in the first place. In a country that heavily censors the internet—where online speech is <em>not</em> free—can you accuse a party official of corruption and get away with it?</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: What is OK to post, and what is <em>not</em> OK to post on Chinese social media?</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: The answer comes to us from some social scientists, who were not even trying to answer this question. But they did. By accident. With big data.</p>

      <p>[MUSIC EXITS]</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: So in August of 2012, the smiling official Yang Dacai is feeling the heat. There are those pictures of him all over Weibo. He’s grinning in front of that burned out bus.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: People are turning up <em>more</em> pictures, showing him wearing these fancy-looking watches.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: But it’s not a complete meltdown for the smiling official until another watch-lover enters the scene. This watch-lover’s name is Boss Hua.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: That’s his Weibo handle, not his real name, by the way.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: Boss Hua is an entrepreneur. He’s in his late-thirties, kind of slim, wears these elegant rimless glasses. And he’s into luxury—like, lifestyle magazine stuff.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: The pictures on Boss Hua’s Instagram look like something out of Conde Nast <em>Traveller</em>. It’s all sepia-toned pictures of elaborate espresso drinks.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: Or lobster dinners.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: Or luxury hotel suites.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: He’s actually a luxury hotel reviewer on the side. But back in 2012, Boss Hua was internet-famous for doing something very, very specific on Sina Weibo. He’d find pictures of corrupt Chinese officials online...and identify their wristwatches. I reached him a few months ago on Skype.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: Hi! Is this Boss Hua?</p>

      <p>BOSS HUA [TRANSLATED]: Hello, can you hear me?</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: You’ll hear our translator Isabelle on the call too.</p>

      <p>ISABELLE [TRANSLATED]: We can hear you!</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: Boss Hua told us this whole watch-identifying thing started as a lark.</p>

      <p>BOSS HUA [TRANSLATED]: At the time, I’d just sold my second start-up, so I had a lot of free time on my hands. And I really like watches. It was really by random chance—I saw some pictures of officials wearing watches on Weibo. I had the time, so I tried to identify them.</p>

      <p>[MUSIC PLAYING]</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: So when Boss Hua says he “really likes” watches...that is an understatement. He’s the kind of watch nerd who cares whether your rolex is stainless steel or rolesor...which is a word I had to look up. It’s fancy Rolex-speak for combination of stainless steel and gold. </p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: Which is to say that when Boss Hua sets out to identify a watch, it’s with the kind of nerdy rigor you expect from career investigative journalists. He is <em>relentless</em>.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: So, say Boss Hua sees a picture of some grinning official in front of a burned out bus, for example. His first step is to head over to Baidu—basically, Chinese Google—and he does a search. The idea is he’s going to find other pictures of this same guy, wearing the same watch, at around the same time.</p>

      <p>BOSS HUA [TRANSLATED]: And since I’m a programmer, I even wrote a little program to help me grab pictures from the internet.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: Boss Hua organizes these pictures into a giant database.</p>

      <p>[BOSS HUA SPEAKING IN CHINESE]</p>

      <p>ISABELLE [TRANSLATING]: At the end I had about 10,000 pictures.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: Oh my God.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: At the end of all this sleuthing, he posts his verdict to Weibo—includes his photo evidence, watch brand, model, and market price.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: And in Weibo’s court of public opinion, Boss Hua is the expert watch witness. So when Weibo users turn up pictures of Yang Dacai, the smiling official from the bus crash, and he’s wearing all these luxury watches, they know who to call.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF [TO BOSS HUA]: Did you already have a research file on Yang Dacai?</p>

      <p>[BOSS HUA SPEAKING IN CHINESE]</p>

      <p>ISABELLE [TRANSLATING]: Yes, because he’s in my database.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: Now, at this moment, the smiling official makes a very crucial miscalculation. He tries to defend himself. He goes onto Weibo and he says basically, “OK, yeah, I’ve got some watches. But only five.”</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: Boss Hua says bullshit.</p>

      <p>[BOSS HUA SPEAKING IN CHINESE]</p>

      <p>ISABELLE: Oh my God. He said, “If you don’t remember, I’ll help you [LAUGHTER] refresh your memories, and every half an hour, I’ll post a picture of your watch, and let’s see how many you have.”</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: [GASPING] Wowwww. OK.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: In the end, the news media reports that the internet surfaced 11 different watches worn by Yang Dacai. Not five. 11. Among them were, reportedly, a Montblanc—</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: —worth $5,000— </p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: an Omega—</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: —worth $10,000—</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: —and a Vacheron Constantin—</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: —worth at least $25,000.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: Three weeks later, smiling official Yang Dacai is fired...and disappears into the opaque disciplinary machinery of the Communist party.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: And Boss Hua? He becomes a folk hero.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: So before we get to our scientists, here’s what strikes me about this story. We know that the Chinese government censors the internet. </p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: With some regularity.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: In fact, way back in 2000, then-President Bill Clinton gives this speech, where he says...</p>

      <p>BILL CLINTON: Now there’s no question China has been trying to crack down on the internet. Good luck. [LAUGHTER] That’s sort of like trying to nail jello to the wall.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: Except by 2012, China’s gotten <em>really good</em> at nailing jello. You’ve probably heard of the “Great Firewall.” It keeps internet users out of Google, Facebook, and Twitter. </p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: And they’ve got another weapon, which is people. In China, there are more than 100,000 people whose only job is to take stuff off the internet that the Chinese government doesn’t want there.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: So in China, most censored posts come down within 24 hours. Within 24 hours, an actual human has looked at your post and decided if it can stay on the internet. </p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: But then, here’s my question about Boss Hua. He’s on Weibo, posting about the smiling officials watches, very strongly implying that there’s no legal way this guy could own these. How does Boss Hua get away with it? </p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: Right. Why doesn’t one of those 100,000 human censors take those posts down?</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: And if the government’s not censoring posts that are calling out a specific party official for corruption...what are they censoring? The people who would figure this out are, at this point, 7,000 miles away. They’re in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They’re those three Harvard data scientists I mentioned.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: We’re going to meet two of them, Professor Gary King, and one of Gary’s grad students at the time, Jennifer Pan. She’s now an assistant professor at Stanford.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: For Gary and Jen, the story actually starts a few years before this watch business. It starts in 2009. And by the way, Gary and Jen do not think they’re studying Chinese censorship.</p>

      <p>GARY KING: Yes, we were interested in automated text analysis.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: It’s a pretty wonky data science thing. Basically, Gary’s figuring out ways to help computers analyze really gigantic databases of text—actually, gigantic databases of Chinese text.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: So, step one. Jen says they needed to build a giant database of Chinese text. </p>

      <p>JENNIFER PAN: And we thought, OK, let’s look at social media because there’s a lot of text there.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: Gary, Jen, and Gary’s other graduate student, Margaret Roberts, partner with a company that’s already downloading Chinese social media posts, en masse. They get access to literally millions of posts. And they’re about to write up this wonky data science paper when they notice a problem.</p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: When they go back to these social media sites, some of these posts they’ve collected aren’t there anymore. The links are broken.</p>

      <p>JENNIFER PAN: And initially we thought this meant that there was something wrong with our data, there was something wrong with the data we’d been collecting.</p>

      <p>GARY KING: And then we got one that said this post has been taken down. It’s been deleted, or it’s being investigated. Investigated! And then if that wasn’t clear enough, over in the bottom righthand corner, there was a little picture of a little cartoon police officer—</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: What?</p>

      <p>GARY KING: —a little picture of a police officer, that’s right. And eventually we learned that there’s cartoon internet police. And they’re Jingjing and Chacha—</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: They have names?</p>

      <p>GARY KING: They have names, yes, you can Google them and you’ll find these funny little pictures.</p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: I totally Googled them. Jingjing and Chacha wear little blue police uniforms. And they’re usually shown standing on top of computer mice or keyboards in this crouching posture that makes it like they’re surfing? </p>

      <p>ELAH FEDER: Like, they’re surfing the web? </p>

      <p>ANNIE MINOFF: I guess?</p>
